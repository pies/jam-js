Jam is a Web 2.0 Javascript library, which is to say, it's a mash-up of bits and pieces from other libraries put together in a neat package. It's also the world's slowest-developing project.

The licence for all Jam-specific code (i.e. code written exclusively for the project) is licenced as Public Domain, while the pieces taken from other libraries (such as Prototype, Dojo, MochiKit, jQuery, MooFX, etc.) is licenced as their authors have decided to licence them).
