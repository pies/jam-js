Much of the code used in JAM was taken from other Javascript libraries.
Those parts of the code are marked as such and licenced as their authors licenced them.

Dojo Toolkit licence:

	The Dojo Toolkit is currently dual-licensed. The preferred license is the
	Academic Free License v2.1*. All Dojo Foundation projects release their
	code under the terms of this license. It is almost never necessary to
	exercise the "dual" portion of the dual-licensing terms since the AFL is
	well written, widely accepted, and incredibly permissive.
